# Path Finding Algorithms

### Background

The goal of the project was to implement two path finding algorithms and compare them. The chosen algorithms were Lee and A*.

### The Application

In the application, a grid is used to represent a map. The grid can be increased or decreased in size, depending on the needs of the player. The player can also set the starting cell and the ending cell and choose the desired algorithm. When the space-bar is pressed, the algorithm will find the nearest path and display it to the player.
